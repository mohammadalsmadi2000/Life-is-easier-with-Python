# PC Uptime Script

This Python script determines how long your PC has been running by calculating the number of seconds since the system boot time. It then converts this number into hours, minutes, and seconds and displays the result in the console.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* psutil module (can be installed using pip)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the script pc_uptime.py.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Install the psutil module by running the following command: pip install psutil
5. Run the script by typing python pc_uptime.py in the terminal.

## Example Output
```
The system has been running for 2 hours, 30 minutes, and 10 seconds.
```

## Advantages

This script provides a quick and easy way to determine how long your PC has been running. It can be useful for troubleshooting purposes or for keeping track of how much time you spend on your computer.

## Limitations

The script only calculates the time since the system boot time, so it does not take into account any time that the computer may have been asleep or in hibernation mode.
