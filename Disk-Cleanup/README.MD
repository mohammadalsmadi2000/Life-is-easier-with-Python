# Clear Temporary Files Python Script

This Python script automates the process of clearing temporary files on a Windows PC. It was created by "Mohammad Smadi" and is freely available for anyone to use and modify.

## Advantages of using this script

* Saves time: Instead of manually running the Disk Cleanup utility and deleting the temporary files, this script automates the process and makes it faster and more efficient.
* Consistent results: The script performs the same steps every time it is run, ensuring that all temporary files are cleared and the same amount of disk space is freed up.
* Customizable: The script can be modified to fit your specific needs and preferences.

## How to use the script

1. Open a command prompt as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.
3. Run the following command:
<pre copy>
<code>
python clear_temp_files.py
</code>
</pre>
4. The script will run the Disk Cleanup utility and delete the remaining temporary files.
5. When the script finishes running, it will display a message indicating that the temporary files have been cleared.

## Notes

* The script requires administrator privileges to run properly, so make sure to run it as an administrator.
* The script deletes all temporary files, including those used by other programs that may still be running. Therefore, it is recommended to save your work and close any open programs before running the script.
* The script is designed to work on Windows PCs only.
* Use this script at your own risk. While it has been tested and is believed to be safe, there is always a risk of data loss or other issues when deleting files.
